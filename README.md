<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jin Mac</h1>

<h4>I'm a recent UCL graduate (BA Geography 1st Class Honours) and 10-week Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp graduate from Le Wagon. From my time at university, I gained skills in R and Python, specifically for data science applications including data analysis, data visualisation, machine learning and mapping. From my time at Le Wagon, I have obtained basic proficiency in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQL, Heroku, git and GitHub, providing me the technical skills necessary to start a job as a junior full-stack web developer. I am currently a Digital Analyst at Tesco, hoping to make use of my fundamentals in data analysis and data science alongside knowledge of software development to deliver data-driven insights and assist the development of features on Tesco's technology platform.</h4>
